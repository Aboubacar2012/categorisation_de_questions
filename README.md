This project is a NLP project.

The first stage is to obtain data with the help of the tool : [stackechange](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new). Here there is query: 

*insert queries*

The second stage is to explore data. In a notebook (P05_01_notebookexploration), you may find different step : cleansing, data wrangling and descriptive analysis. 

After that, the second is to tidy textuel data and transform data in order to classify topics with machine learning algorithmes. A first approach is to use unsupervised learning. In this case, unsupervised learning help us to find some topics in our data.
